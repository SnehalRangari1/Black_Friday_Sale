# Black Friday Sales ML Project

This project aims to predict the purchase amount of customers on the Black Friday sales event based on their demographic information, purchase history, and product categories. The dataset used for this project is a sample of the transactions made in a retail store on a single day, which includes information on customer demographics, product details, and purchase amount.

The project uses machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model that can accurately estimate the purchase amount of customers. The models employed in this project include Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

The project also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data and understand the relationships between the features and the target variable. The EDA covers visualizations such as histograms, heatmaps, and box plots to reveal patterns and correlations in the data.

This project is useful for retailers who want to understand the purchasing behavior of their customers and make informed decisions on their marketing strategies and product offerings. The predictive model developed in this project can also be used to make personalized product recommendations and offer targeted discounts to customers.
